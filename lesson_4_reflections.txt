When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when you want to be able to send updates from a different computer than the original repsoitory on on
- when you want other individuals to be able to make changes (from their computers)
- when you want other individuals to be able to view and/or download content from this repository


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- other people may be making changes, and I don't want to get suprised by unexpected changes


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When woudl you use one instead of the other?

- forks are a clone done on the GitHub server from a repository in one account to a new repository in the logged in account
- clones are a copy created from the GitHub server to a local repository, or fro a local respository to a new repository
- a branch is when a new branch is made in a repository


- forks are used to make a new copy from another user to your repository all on the GitHub server.  The purpose is to set up a new copy of the original for you to tweak.
- clones are typically for making a local copy that can be edited, from a GitHub repository.  Could also make the clone from a local repository.
- branch is used for feature development within a repository
