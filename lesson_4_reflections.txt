When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when you want to be able to send updates from a different computer than the original repsoitory on on
- when you want other individuals to be able to make changes (from their computers)
- when you want other individuals to be able to view and/or download content from this repository


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- other people may be making changes, and I don't want to get suprised by unexpected changes
