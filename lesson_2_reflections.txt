What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

- creates hidden .git subdirectory (containis metadata)
- need to create the structure that can track files and commits


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

- staging area contains files that could be committed
- staging area only contains some of the files in the repository

- value is to track what is available to be committed


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- move changes from the working directory to the staging area in blocks corresponding 
  to a logical change
- commit after the files for each logical change have been added to the staging area
